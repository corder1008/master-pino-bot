        "<b>Transaction Monitoring</b>\n" +

        "<b>Risk Management Features</b>\n" + 
        "How do I set up stop-loss and take-profit orders?\n" + 
        "Use the following commands to manage your trades: /set_stop <percentage>: Set a stop-loss to automatically sell if the price drops by the specified percentage. Example: /set_stop 5 will set a 5% stop-loss on your trades. /take_profit <percentage>: Set a take-profit level to automatically sell when the price increases by the specified percentage. Example: /take_profit 10 will set a 10% take-profit. \n\n" +
